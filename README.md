# Expiry Date Generator GUI

This GUI application allows the user to generate the expiry date of a product based on its production date and shelf life.

## Getting Started

To use the Expiry Date Generator GUI, you'll need to have Python 3 and the Tkinter library installed on your computer. If you're using a version of Python that includes Tkinter, such as Python 3.1 or later, you should already have it installed. Otherwise, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install tkinter

```


Once you have Python and Tkinter installed, you can run the application by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python expiry_date_generator.py

```


## Usage

1. Enter the production date of the product in the format "DD/MM/YYYY" in the "Production Date" field.
2. Enter the shelf life of the product in days in the "Shelf Life" field.
3. Click the "Generate Expiry Date" button.
4. The expiry date of the product will be displayed in the "Expiry Date" field.
